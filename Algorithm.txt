Algorithm 
Step 1: Initialize make the distance traveled the variable 'd', and speed of the object 's'
Step 2: Get user to input 'd' in meters and 's' in meters per second values 
Step 3: Create method called TimeCalc that takes parameters 'd' and 's' that computes and returns d/s
Step 5: Output TimeCalc
