question: A sprinkler is 1.0 m away from a wall. It sprays to a maximum height of 0.75 m and has a range of 1.5 m. At what height will the water hit the wall?

Fist determine the roots using logic (0 and 1.5) 
Knowing that the max height is at 0.75, solve for the time (which is the aos, 0.75)
solve for 'a' in factored form (y=a(x)(x-1.5)) using the given vertex  (0.75, 0.75)
After finding the a value (-1.33), insert 1 as the x value and solve for the height (0.66)
thus, the finial height at which the sprinker hits the wall is at 0.66m.
